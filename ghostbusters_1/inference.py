        The noisyDistance is the estimated Manhattan distance to the ghost you

        The emissionModel below stores the probability of the noisyDistance for
        any true distance you supply. That is, it stores P(noisyDistance |

        self.legalPositions is a list of the possible ghost positions (you

        The transition model is not entirely stationary: it may depend on
        Pacman's current position (e.g., for DirectionalGhost).  However, this
        is not a problem, as Pacman's current position is known.

        In order to obtain the distribution over new positions for the ghost,
        given its previous position (oldPos) as well as Pacman's current
        position, use this line of code:

          newPosDist = self.getPositionDistribution(self.setGhostPosition(gameState, oldPos))

        Note that you may need to replace "oldPos" with the correct name of the
        variable that you have used to refer to the previous ghost position for
        which you are computing this distribution. You will need to compute
        multiple position distributions for a single update.

        newPosDist is a util.Counter object, where for each position p in
        self.legalPositions,

        newPostDist[p] = Pr( ghost is at position p at time t + 1 | ghost is at position oldPos at time t )

        (and also given Pacman's current position).  You may also find it useful
        to loop over key, value pairs in newPosDist, like:

          for newPos, prob in newPosDist.items():
            ...

        *** GORY DETAIL AHEAD ***

        As an implementation detail (with which you need not concern yourself),
        the line of code at the top of this comment block for obtaining
        newPosDist makes use of two helper methods provided in InferenceModule
        above:

          1) self.setGhostPosition(gameState, ghostPosition)
              This method alters the gameState by placing the ghost we're
              tracking in a particular position.  This altered gameState can be
              used to query what the ghost would do in this position.

          2) self.getPositionDistribution(gameState)
              This method uses the ghost agent to determine what positions the
              ghost will move to from the provided gameState.  The ghost must be
              placed in the gameState with a call to self.setGhostPosition
              above.

        It is worthwhile, however, to understand why these two helper methods
        are used and how they combine to give us a belief distribution over new
        positions after a time update from a particular position.
