Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years ago, Pacman's 
great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his power and could only track 
ghosts by their banging and clanging. 

In this project, we design Pacman agents that use sensors to locate and eat invisible ghosts. 
We will locate single, stationary ghosts as well as hunt down packs of multiple moving ghosts.
