Pacman lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats. Navigating this world efficiently will be 
Pacman's first step in mastering his domain. We use this game as a model to understand how different search algorithms work. 
In this project, our Pacman agent will find paths through his maze world, both to reach a particular location and to 
collect food efficiently. The supporting files for this project can be found [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/search.html).
