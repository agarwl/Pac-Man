Pacman lives in a shiny blue world of twisting corridors and tasty round treats. 
Navigating this world efficiently will be Pacman's first step in mastering his domain. 
We use this game as a model to understand how different search algorithms work. 
  
In this project, I designed agents for the classic version of Pacman, including ghosts. Along the way, 
I also implemented both minimax and expectimax search and tried my hand at evaluation function design. 
The helper files for this project can be found [here](http://ai.berkeley.edu/multiagent.html).
